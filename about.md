### Hello,
I'm Vin√≠cius a 30 years old developer with 15 years of experience with IT and 3 of them developing with Ruby and Rails.
Some time ago I made a course on Campus Code to learn Rails with TDD and best practices.
I paired with a senior developer of them on a project with newbies developers coding for partner companies, that experience made the difference in my career on the way that I look and write code.
