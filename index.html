  <p class="my-3">
    I'm Vinicius a 30 years old developer👨🏽‍💻 with 15 years messing with IT and 3 of them web
    developing with Ruby and Rails (I already developed in C on college <del> and Java, but I don't want to talk
      about this previous crime)</del>.
  </p>

  <p class="my-3">
    Before I become a developer I worked as a basic IT teacher on Microlins and start IT college 3 times
    until I finally took a course on <a href="https://www.campuscode.com.br" target="_blank">Campus Code</a>
    to learn about Rails with TDD and best practices and start my carreer.
  </p>

  <p class="my-3">
    I was invited to work with them after the course in a new project for newbies developers, I paired with a
    senior developer coding for partner companies and that experience made the difference on the way I look and
    write code.
