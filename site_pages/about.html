<h3> Hello people!</h3>

<p>
  I'm Vinicius a 30 years old developer👨🏽‍💻 with 15 years messing with IT and 3 of them web
  developing with Ruby and Rails (I already developed in C on college <del> and Java, but I don't want to talk
    about this previous crime)</del>.
</p>

<p>
  Before I become a developer I worked as a basic IT teacher on Microlins and start IT college 3 times
  until I finally took a course on <a href="https://www.campuscode.com.br" target="_blank">Campus Code</a>
  to learn about Rails with TDD and best practices and start my carreer.
</p>

<p>
  I was invited to work with them after the course in a new project for newbies developers, I paired with a
  senior developer coding for partner companies and that experience made the difference on the way I look and
  write code.
