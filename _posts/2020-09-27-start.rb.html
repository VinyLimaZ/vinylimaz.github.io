<h3>Hey guys!</h3>

<p>
  Like you may already saw, I'm Vinicius and I'll start to write some thoughts in this blog/site.
</p>

<p>
  I already have a lot of blogs, some of them to write some poems, others to write my thoughts when I was high (lol), but,
  even I had started to work with IT in 2005, I never write about tech stuff.
  That's very strange, but let's check this from my things to do before die list.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> lover and I'm one of the lover on
  <a href="https://t.me/rubybrasil" target="_blank">RubyBrasil</a> group, a telegram group to talk about Ruby.
  My first time with Ruby was around end of 2017 when I was participating of the Quero Ser Dev (I want to be a dev) by
  Locaweb, a event to find and hire people that have/haven't dev expertise and want to work with Ruby on Locaweb. The
  event is old and already provide chance for a lot of people to learn and start on this beautiful profession.
</p>

<p>
  It have had some steps to be hired, an online logical test, an online course
 (<a href="https://codesaga.com.br/" target="_blank">Code saga</a>, it's free and open for everyone!) with a points
 system, after those steps we have 2 more: a group dynamic and the <a
   href="https://campuscode.com.br/treinamentos/imersao-web-aprendendo-com-projetos-reais" target="_blank" >Web
   Immersion</a> by <a href="www.campuscode.com.br">Campus Code</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I took the steps and was eliminated on the group dinamyc ðŸ˜­, but this didn't make me give up of my desire to be a dev,
  I was working with client support but doing some very small dev things to automatize some PITA jobs of me and
  colleagues and I already was with this in mind, I loved the first steps that introduce me the Ruby and
  <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Rails</a>, at that time I already messed with Java in the College
  and C (Either on college but less than Java) and looking how beautiful and expressive Ruby is I fall in love for it
  and when you love something you go all the way to had that, and was what I did.
</p>

<p>
  With the help of my job I receive a discount on the Immersion on Campus Code and I did the training and was one of the
  best things that I did on my life, the course was very awesome and I had a chance to learn a lot of good practices and
  things important for the enterprise world.
</p>

<p>
  After the training I was invited to work on Campus Code and paired with some seniors dev that worked with them at that
  time, this made a big difference in the way that I write code and think in code, it were a very amazing experience
  that made helped me be hired on the BioRitmo/SmartFit company as a junior web developer \o/
</p>

<p>
  That was how my code life began, had a lot of things before that made all this happen, like my computer basic course
  on Microlins, the intern that I took there and the time that I taught some classes there, the forums of games creation
  that I learned about the <a href="https://www.clickteam.com/the-games-factory-2" target="">The Games Factory</a>
  and made some games and animations.
</p>

<p>
  That's a brief storie of how I became a developer, on the next posts I'll start to write about real tech stuffs! Stay
  tuned!
